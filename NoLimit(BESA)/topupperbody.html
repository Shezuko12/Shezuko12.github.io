     <center><h3 class="my-4" style="background-color:darkorange;"> Planks </h3></center>
      <p>An excellent all-round exercise, planks will boost your arm, back, chest, shoulder and upper body strength whilst also targeting your core and glutes.</p>
      <p>To Perform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lie on a mat with your forearms on the floor just under each shoulder and feet hip-width apart</li>
        <li>With your toes on the floor, lift up so your bodyweight is balanced on your forearms and toes</li>
        <li>Focus on keeping your core engaged and your shoulder blades relaxed</li>
        <li>Hold for as long as you can, working on increasing the time as you get stronger</li>
      </ul>

     <center><h3 class="my-4" style="background-color:darkorange;"> Inchworm Workout </h3></center>
      <p>The inchworm exercise is a solid movement to add to just about any routine. Because it has the ability to strengthen and stretch different muscle groups at the same time, it's ideally positioned to be included as part of an active warm-up, or as part of a high-intensity interval training routine. The strengthening part of the movement comes when you're entering, exiting, and holding the plank portion of the movement. As you step your hands forward, away from your feet, your shoulders, triceps, chest, and eventually your abdominals, the stabilizing muscles of your shoulders and hips, your glutes, and your quadriceps all engage to support your body's weight as you enter the plank.</p>
       <br>
       <p>There are two ways to do the inchworm—one involves traveling across a distance, requiring you to have at least 15 to 20 feet of space to move, and the other has you stay in place, requiring no more space than roughly the length of your own body. While neither version is better or worse, the traveling version requires more engagement of your lower body and is considered the typical version of the exercise. If you have the space available, plan on using it, and follow these step-by-step instructions. If you don't have the space available, follow the modified version of the exercise, detailed below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stand tall, your feet roughly hip-distance apart. Check your posture—your ears should be aligned over your shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles, your abdominals engaged.</li>
        <li>WiTake a breath in, then as you exhale, look down at the ground and start reaching your hands toward the floor in front of your feet, allowing your back to bend forward, rolling down one vertebra at a time. Allow your knees to bend slightly, as needed, to enable your hands to reach the ground.</li>
        <li>Place your hands on the floor in front of your feet. Inhale and walk your hands forward, one at a time, allowing your heels to lift off the floor as your body begins to straighten. When your hands are directly under your shoulders, check your form—you should be in a full plank position with your core, chest, quads, triceps, and shoulders engaged, your body forming a straight line from heels to head.</li>
        <li>Keep your legs relatively straight and begin walking your feet forward, one at a time, toward your hands. This should provide a nice stretch through your hamstrings, calves, and glutes as your hips start lifting toward the ceiling. Exhale as you step forward.</li>
        <li>Stop when your feet are as close to your hands as you can comfortably bring them. Remember, you can bend your knees slightly to ease the stretch on your hamstrings, but try to keep them as straight as possible.</li>
        <li>Return to standing by slowly rolling your back up from the hips, straightening one vertebra at a time. Inhale as you go. When you're back in the starting position, you've completed one repetition. Continue for time or repetitions, depending on your workout.</li>
      </ol>
